# Unity Development Tools
This repository is a collection of several tools and code snippets to improve development speed and practices for the [Unity game engine](https://unity3d.com/).

## Getting Started

The easiest way to make use of the provided tools, is to download the zip of the project and copy-paste the parts you want into your Unity solution.

(If you don't know how to open .zip files, you can simply install [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) to open it, and extract the folders where you want them.)
