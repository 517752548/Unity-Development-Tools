# Attributes
Have you ever seen that sometimes above classes, methods and even fields people use some type of commands between brackeys? i.e.

[ContextMenu("Some Text")]
public void MyMethod()

Well those are called attributes, in fact, [Unity has many already built-in for you to play with](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AddComponentMenu.html), stuff like show private fields, add tooltips, headers, etc. 

What you will be finding here are custom made ones that are useful for other things not included in the built-in solutions, and I assure you will get to love some of these.
