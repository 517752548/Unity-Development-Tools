# Scriptable Object Factory
This tool adds a dockable editor window that allows the easy creation of **Scriptable Objects**, without the need to individually implement the ```[CreateAssetMenu("Some Directory")]``` attribute.

For further documentation on this tool and Scriptable Objects, refer to [Arzola's devblog](http://heisarzola.com/devblog/unity-tip-3/).

## Scriptable Object Factory Acknowledgments

* [Liortal](https://github.com/liortal53/) - For providing the base for the Scriptable Object Factory. The original work was improved to be able to support the "first-pass" assembly (for Scriptable Objects in the Plugins/Standard Assets/Pro Standard Assets folders), to be able to show namespaces, and to provide a cleaner default naming convention for created assets.
